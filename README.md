# DCIT 318 – Programming II  
## Assignment 2 – Object-Oriented Programming in C#

**Student ID:** 11021379

### 📘 Description
This assignment demonstrates key concepts of object-oriented programming in C# through three console applications. Topics covered include inheritance, abstraction, and interface implementation.


### 📂 Project Structure

#### 1. 🧱 `AbstractShapes/Program.cs`
- Implements **abstract classes** and **polymorphism**.
- Defines base shape class and specific derived shapes (e.g., Circle, Rectangle).
- Demonstrates method overriding for calculating area or perimeter.

#### 2. 👨‍👦 `InheritanceAndOverriding/Program.cs`
- Demonstrates **class inheritance** and **method overriding**.
- Models a parent-child class relationship.
- Highlights how base class methods can be extended or replaced.

#### 3. 🔌 `InterfacesDemo/Program.cs`
- Demonstrates use of **interfaces** to define behavior contracts.
- Implements interfaces in different classes.
- Illustrates interface-based programming and multiple implementations.
